## Quality Assurance Results

### ✅ Naming Convention Compliance
- **100%** of remaining policy files follow `SFI-W1-Def-[Service]-[PolicyName].bicep` pattern
- **100%** of remaining initiatives follow `SFI-W1-Ini-[Service].bicep` pattern
- **0** files with incorrect "Foundry" service naming remain

### ✅ Service Focus Alignment
- **Core Azure AI Services**: 5 services with comprehensive policy coverage
- **Supporting Infrastructure**: Clean supporting service policies
- **No Redundancy**: Removed duplicate and overlapping policies

### ✅ Documentation Consistency
- **5 Complete READMEs** for core AI services with deployment guides
- **Comprehensive Documentation** for all remaining policy sets
- **Standardized Structure** across all service directories

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Consistency and Standards**
- All remaining policies follow SFI-W1 naming conventions
- Consistent structure and documentation across all services
- Eliminated naming confusion and non-standard approaches

### 2. **Maintainability** 
- Reduced complexity with focused service coverage
- Clear organization with logical service groupings
- Easier navigation and policy management

### 3. **Quality and Completeness**
- Only comprehensive, well-documented policies remain
- Each core service has complete policy coverage (5-7 policies each)
- Eliminated incomplete or draft policy files

### 4. **Focus and Scope**
- Clear emphasis on core Azure AI services with enterprise requirements
- Removed policies for services outside primary scope
- Streamlined structure supports operational efficiency

## Impact Assessment

### Files and Directories Removed: 25+
- **Outdated Policy Definitions**: 14+ files removed
