# 🔗 Azure Tenant Security Solution (AzTS) Integration Guide

## 📋 **Overview**

This guide explains how to integrate the Azure AI Bicep Modules with Azure Tenant Security Solution (AzTS) for comprehensive security monitoring and compliance across your AI infrastructure.

## 🎯 **Integration Benefits**

### **✅ Comprehensive Coverage**
- **Infrastructure Security**: AzTS monitors foundational services (Storage, Key Vault, ML Workspace)
- **AI-Specific Governance**: Your Policy-as-Code framework covers AI-specific requirements
- **Continuous Monitoring**: AzTS provides ongoing compliance validation
- **Custom Controls**: Your policies fill gaps for newer AI services

### **📊 Coverage Matrix**

| **Service** | **AzTS Support** | **Your Policies** | **Combined Coverage** |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Storage Account | ✅ Full | ✅ Enhanced | 🏆 Comprehensive |
| Key Vault | ✅ Full | ✅ Enhanced | 🏆 Comprehensive |
| Machine Learning | ✅ Full | ✅ Enhanced | 🏆 Comprehensive |
| Cognitive Search | ✅ Full | ✅ Enhanced | 🏆 Comprehensive |
| Logic Apps | ✅ Full | ✅ Enhanced | 🏆 Comprehensive |
| Cognitive Services | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Full | 🏆 Comprehensive |
| Azure OpenAI | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full | 🏆 Comprehensive |
| AI Foundry | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full | 🏆 Comprehensive |
| Copilot Studio | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full | 🏆 Comprehensive |
| Document Intelligence | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full | 🏆 Comprehensive |

## 🚀 **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Deploy Infrastructure with Enhanced Security**

```bash
# Deploy with your enterprise-grade modules
cd azure-ai-bicep-modules
./scripts/deployment/deploy-infrastructure.sh --environment prod --location eastus

# Deploy comprehensive policy framework
cd policies/scripts
./deploy-all-policies.sh --location eastus --subscription-id "your-sub-id"
```

### **Phase 2: Enable AzTS Monitoring**

1. **Set up AzTS in your tenant**:
   ```powershell
   # Follow AzTS setup guide
   # https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/tree/main/01-Setup%20and%20getting%20started
   ```

2. **Configure AzTS to scan your AI subscriptions**:
   - Include subscriptions containing your AI workloads
   - Enable scanning for supported resource types
   - Configure scan frequency (daily recommended)

### **Phase 3: Custom Control Integration**

#### **3.1 Extend AzTS with Custom Controls**

Create custom AzTS controls for AI services not natively supported:

```json
{
  "controlId": "Custom_AzureOpenAI_Security_PrivateEndpoint",
  "description": "Azure OpenAI must use private endpoints",
  "resourceType": "Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts",
  "apiVersion": "2023-05-01",
  "properties": [
    "properties.publicNetworkAccess"
  ],
  "evaluationLogic": {
    "operator": "eq",
    "value": "Disabled"
  }
}
```

#### **3.2 Policy-as-Code Integration**

Your existing policy framework already provides superior coverage:

```bash
# Deploy AI-specific initiatives
az policy assignment create \
  --name "AI-Security-Initiative" \
  --policy-set-definition "/subscriptions/{sub-id}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/SFI-W1-Ini-CognitiveServices" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}"
```

## 📊 **Monitoring and Reporting**

### **Unified Dashboard Approach**

1. **AzTS Dashboard**: Monitor foundational service compliance
2. **Azure Policy Compliance**: Track AI-specific policy adherence
3. **Custom Workbooks**: Combine both data sources for comprehensive view

### **Sample Log Analytics Query**

```kusto
// Combined AzTS and Policy Compliance View
union 
  (AzTSData_CL | where ResourceType_s in ("Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts", "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults")),
  (PolicyStates | where PolicyDefinitionName contains "SFI-W1")
| summarize 
    ComplianceRate = avg(case(ComplianceState_s == "Compliant" or ComplianceState == "Compliant", 100.0, 0.0))
  by ResourceType = coalesce(ResourceType_s, ResourceType)
```

## 🔒 **Security Best Practices**

### **1. Defense in Depth**
- **Layer 1**: Your Bicep modules with secure-by-default configurations
- **Layer 2**: Policy-as-Code for ongoing governance
- **Layer 3**: AzTS for continuous compliance monitoring
- **Layer 4**: Microsoft Defender for Cloud for threat protection

### **2. AI-Specific Security Controls**

```bicep
// Example: Enhanced OpenAI security beyond AzTS
module openAI 'modules/azure-openai/main.bicep' = {
  params: {
    // Beyond standard security - AI-specific controls
    publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'           // AzTS + Your policies
    customSubDomainName: 'mycompany-ai'       // Your policies
    contentFilters: [                         // Your policies (AI-specific)
      {
        name: 'strict-enterprise'
        selfHarmSeverity: 'low'
        hateSeverity: 'low'
        violenceSeverity: 'low'
        sexualSeverity: 'low'
      }
    ]
    modelDeployments: [                       // Your policies (AI governance)
      {
        name: 'gpt-4o-approved'
        ratePolicyName: 'enterprise-throttling'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
